## About the book

Amazon Web Services in Action, Second Edition is a comprehensive introduction to computing, storing, and networking in the AWS cloud. You'll find clear, relevant coverage of all the essential AWS services you to know, emphasizing best practices for security, high availability and scalability. The practical, hands-on examples include different approaches to deploying applications on AWS, how to secure your infrastructure by isolating networks, and controlling traffic and managing access to AWS resources. You'll also learn to integrate AWS services into your own applications using SDKs and gain handy ideas on how to design applications for high availability, fault tolerance, and scalability.

Fully updated to include the latest revisions and updates to AWS; this new edition also offers three new chapters covering the latest additions to the AWS platform: serverless infrastructure automation with AWS Lambda, sharing data volumes between machines with EFS, and caching data in memory with ElastiCache!
